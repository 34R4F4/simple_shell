# PID & PPID

## PID process id
A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call `getpid` (`man 2 getpid`)

> pid.c

~~~
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic pid.c -o mypid && ./mypid
~~~

Note in the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.

Each process has a parent: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the getppid system call (`man 2 getppid`), from within the child process.

## PPID parent process id

> ppid.c

~~~
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic ppid.c -o myppid && ./myppid
~~~
~~~
$ echo $$
~~~
they will be the same value, because it is the parent process id (the current working shell).

## PID_MAx

`
/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
`
prints the maximum value a process ID can be

> pid_max.sh

~~~
$ chmod +x pid_max.sh
$ ./pid_max.sh
~~~

## Arguments

The command line arguments are passed through the main function: `int main(int ac, char **av);`

  - `av` is a `NULL` terminated array of strings
  - `ac` is the number of items in `av`

`av[0]` usually contains the name used to invoke the current program.
`av[1]` is the first argument of the program, `av[2]` the second, and so on.

### av

> print_args.c

Write a program that prints all the arguments, without using ac.

~~~
$ gcc print_args.c -o print_args
$ ./print_args arg1 arg2 arg3
~~~

###  Read line

Write a program that prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter a command, prints it on the next line.

`man 3 getline`

Write your own version of `getline`

> prompt.c

~~~
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic prompt.c -o prompt
$ ./prompt
~~~

### command line to av
Write a function that splits a string and returns an array of each word of the string.

`man strtok`

> strtok.c

~~~
$ gcc strtok.c -o strtok
$ ./strtok
~~~

> _strtok.c

---

## Executing a program

The system call `execve` allows a process to execute another program (`man 2 execve`)

> exec.c

~~~
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic exec.c -o exec
$ ./exec
~~~

~~~c
 char *argv[] = {"/bin/ls", "-l", "/usr/", NULL};
    /**
     * argv[0]: command path		bin/ls
     * argv[1]: command option		-l
     * argv[2]: command target		/usr/
     * argv[3]: command env		NULL
     */

 char *envv[] = {};	//NULL
 execve(argv[0], argv, envv);
 /** execve (command_path, argv, env) */
~~~

---

## Creating processes

The system call `fork` (`man 2 fork`) creates a new child process, almost identical to the parent (the process that calls `fork`). Once `fork` successfully returns, two processes continue to run the same program, but with different stacks, datas and heaps.

> fork.c

~~~
$ gcc fork.c -o fork
$ ./fork
~~~

Using the return value of fork, it is possible to know if the current process is the father or the child: 

	* fork will return 
	 0					to the child
	 PID of the child 	to the father
	 -1		 			if failuar

* code:
	- step1
	- step2
	- fork
	- step3
	- step4

* execusion:
	* parent
		- step1
		- step2
		- fork
		- step3
		- step4
	* child
		- step3
		- step4
