# PID & PPID

## PID process id
A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current processâ€™ ID, you can use the system call `getpid` (`man 2 getpid`)

> pid.c

~~~
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic pid.c -o mypid && ./mypid
~~~

Note in the example above, that every time you run the program, a new process is created, and its ID is different.

Each process has a parent: the process that created it. It is possible to get the PID of a parent process by using the getppid system call (man 2 getppid), from within the child process.

## PPID parent process id

> ppid.c
~~~
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic ppid.c -o myppid && ./myppid
~~~
~~~
$ echo $$
~~~
they will be the same value, because it is the parent process id (the current working shell).

## PID_MAx
~
/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
~
prints the maximum value a process ID can be

> pid_max.sh
~~~
$ chmod +x pid_max.sh
$ ./pid_max.sh
~~~
